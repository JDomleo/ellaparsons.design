    <p>Below is a list of a few logo designs I have created in my spare time. The design briefs come from <a href="https://designers.designcrowd.co.uk/designer.aspx?designerId=842923" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Design Crowd</a>. I can follow a design brief really clearly and if a brief isn't provided, I use my initiative and creativity to take over to design something I hope the client likes.</p>

We work with people (about 65% male and 35% women) aged about 45 years and older, who are experiencing at least moderate levels of dissatisfaction in their life. They may feel like they haven\'t been on the right path in life, their life has lost meaning and enthusiasm as they\'ve aged and now they are seeking something more from life, but they\'re not sure what exactly. Perhaps they\'ve played life on autopilot, conforming to expectations and responsibilities. Ultimately they are deep thinkers, searching for more. They have a high level of intelligence, not measured by traditional standards. I like the colours of nature: greens, blues, oranges (sunrise and sunset), shades of grey and brown. I am drawn to the idea nature, winding pathways, water, animals , etcetera. I am also very open to suggestions about colour and logo in other areas if you have something in mind. I prefer flowing lines and curves, over geometrical hard edged shapes, but I am open to suggestions in the other direction too if you feel its appropriate.. The final design should communicate honesty, trust, hope, compassion and courage. It needs to feel inviting and welcoming, like they are "coming home", a sense of reconnecting with themselves, or with something wonderful. The logo should have a timeless, enduring yet somewhat modern feel to it. It needs to appeal to both sexes, but have a bit of a masculine/strength to it. Perhaps a little bit of abstract, but not too much. Some logos that appealed to me are attached. I would like to use this for other areas of marketing including website, business cards, etc so it needs to be able to be expanded and reduced in size accordingly.'

We will be wielding this equipment to process all kinds of metals more efficiently than other companies. Therefore, our processing system is very efficient and compassionate.
